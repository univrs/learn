# Welcome to Univrs Tutorials

Master the Univrs ecosystem through hands-on, progressive learning paths. Our tutorials follow the **Learning Flywheel** - a continuous cycle of learning, building, and creating that accelerates your development skills.

## The Learning Flywheel

```
                    Learn DOL
                       |
                       v
          +------------------------+
          |                        |
          |    Build Spirits   <---+
          |         |              |
          |         v              |
          |   Create Content       |
          |         |              |
          +---------+--------------+
                    |
                    v
               Master CLI
```

The flywheel represents the Univrs learning philosophy:

1. **Learn DOL** - Understand the Design Ontology Language fundamentals
2. **Build Spirits** - Create secure, composable WebAssembly programs
3. **Create Content** - Contribute tutorials, examples, and documentation
4. **Master CLI** - Become proficient with development tools

Each turn of the flywheel builds momentum, making the next rotation easier and more powerful.
