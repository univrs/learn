# Version Evolution

Real-world specifications change over time. DOL's `evo` keyword provides a declarative way to specify **how types change between versions**, enabling automatic migration and backward compatibility checks.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand version evolution concepts
- Write `evo` declarations for type migration
- Specify field additions, removals, and transformations
- Apply backward compatibility strategies

## The Evolution Problem

As systems grow, types need to change:

```dol
// Version 1.0.0
gen User {
    has id: u64
    has name: string
    has email: string
}

// Version 2.0.0 needs more fields!
gen User {
    has id: u64
    has name: string
    has email: string
    has avatar_url: Option<string>     // New!
    has created_at: Timestamp          // New!
    has settings: UserSettings         // New!
}
```

Without explicit evolution, consumers of your spec don't know:
- What changed?
- How do old records migrate?
- Is it backward compatible?

## The evo Declaration

The `evo` keyword declares how a type changes:

```dol
evo UserV1 > UserV2 @ 2.0.0 {
    + avatar_url: Option<string> = None
    + created_at: Timestamp = Timestamp.now()
    + settings: UserSettings = UserSettings.default()
}
```

This declares:
- **Source**: `UserV1` - the previous version
- **Target**: `UserV2` - the new version
- **Version**: `@ 2.0.0` - when this evolution applies
- **Changes**: Field additions with default values

<Tip type="info">
The `evo` declaration serves as both documentation and migration specification. Tools can use it to auto-generate migration code.
</Tip>

## Evolution Operators

DOL provides operators for different changes:

### Adding Fields (+)

Add new fields with default values:

```dol
evo ProductV1 > ProductV2 @ 1.1.0 {
    + description: string = ""
    + tags: Vec<string> = []
    + rating: Option<f64> = None
    + is_active: bool = true
}
```

### Removing Fields (-)

Remove deprecated fields:

```dol
evo ProductV2 > ProductV3 @ 2.0.0 {
    - legacy_code: string
    - old_category_id: u64
}
```

<Tip type="warning">
Removing fields is a breaking change. The `-` operator documents this but doesn't make it backward compatible.
</Tip>

### Renaming Fields (~)

Rename fields while preserving data:

```dol
evo CustomerV1 > CustomerV2 @ 1.2.0 {
    ~ full_name -> name
    ~ phone_number -> phone
    ~ mailing_address -> address
}
```

### Transforming Fields (=>)

Transform field values during migration:

```dol
evo OrderV1 > OrderV2 @ 2.0.0 {
    // Split name into first/last
    => name: string to (first_name: string, last_name: string) {
        split_name(name)
    }

    // Convert cents to decimal
    => price_cents: u64 to price: Decimal {
        Decimal.from_cents(price_cents)
    }
}
```

## Complete Evolution Example

Here is a comprehensive user type evolution:

```dol
mod users @ 0.8.0

// Original type (v1.0.0)
gen UserV1 {
    has id: u64
    has name: string
    has email: string
}

// Version 1.1.0: Add optional profile fields
gen UserV1_1 {
    has id: u64
    has name: string
    has email: string
    has avatar_url: Option<string>
    has bio: Option<string>
}

evo UserV1 > UserV1_1 @ 1.1.0 {
    + avatar_url: Option<string> = None
    + bio: Option<string> = None
}

// Version 2.0.0: Add authentication and settings
gen UserV2 {
    has id: u64
    has name: string
    has email: string
    has avatar_url: Option<string>
    has bio: Option<string>
    has created_at: Timestamp
    has settings: UserSettings
    has auth_provider: AuthProvider
}

evo UserV1_1 > UserV2 @ 2.0.0 {
    + created_at: Timestamp = Timestamp.now()
    + settings: UserSettings = UserSettings.default()
    + auth_provider: AuthProvider = AuthProvider.Email
}

// Supporting types
gen UserSettings {
    has theme: Theme
    has notifications_enabled: bool
    has email_frequency: EmailFrequency
}

gen Theme {
    kind: enum { Light, Dark, System }
}

gen EmailFrequency {
    kind: enum { Immediate, Daily, Weekly, Never }
}

gen AuthProvider {
    kind: enum { Email, Google, GitHub, Apple }
}
```

## Multi-Step Evolution

Track evolution across multiple versions:

```dol
mod products @ 0.8.0

// Evolution chain: V1 -> V2 -> V3 -> V4

evo ProductV1 > ProductV2 @ 1.1.0 {
    + description: string = ""
    + tags: Vec<string> = []
}

evo ProductV2 > ProductV3 @ 2.0.0 {
    + category: Category = Category.Uncategorized
    - legacy_sku: string  // Removed deprecated field
    ~ product_name -> name  // Renamed for consistency
}

evo ProductV3 > ProductV4 @ 3.0.0 {
    + variants: Vec<ProductVariant> = []
    + inventory: InventoryInfo = InventoryInfo.default()
    => price: f64 to pricing: PricingInfo {
        PricingInfo { base_price: price, currency: "USD" }
    }
}
```

## Backward Compatibility Rules

Evolution can be classified by compatibility:

### Fully Backward Compatible

- Adding optional fields with defaults
- Adding new enum variants (if consumers handle unknown)

```dol
evo ConfigV1 > ConfigV2 @ 1.1.0 {
    // Safe: optional with default
    + new_feature_enabled: bool = false
    + cache_ttl: Option<u64> = None
}
```

### Requires Migration

- Adding required fields
- Changing field types
- Renaming fields

```dol
evo DataV1 > DataV2 @ 2.0.0 {
    // Requires migration: new required field
    + required_field: string = compute_default()

    // Requires migration: type change
    => old_int: i32 to new_int: i64 { old_int.to_i64() }
}
```

### Breaking Changes

- Removing fields
- Removing enum variants
- Changing field semantics

```dol
evo ApiV1 > ApiV2 @ 2.0.0 {
    // Breaking: field removed
    - deprecated_field: string

    // Breaking: enum variant removed
    // (document separately)
}
```

## Evolution Rules

Add rules to evolution:

```dol
evo OrderV1 > OrderV2 @ 2.0.0 {
    + shipping_address: Address = Address.empty()
    + billing_address: Option<Address> = None

    rule PostMigration {
        forall order in orders {
            // After migration, ensure valid state
            order.status == "completed" implies order.shipping_address.is_valid()
        }
    }
}
```

## Version Metadata

Include metadata with versions:

```dol
mod api @ 0.8.0

version_history {
    1.0.0: "Initial release"
    1.1.0: "Added user profiles"
    1.2.0: "Added activity tracking"
    2.0.0: "Breaking: new authentication system"
    2.1.0: "Added OAuth providers"
    3.0.0: "Breaking: removed legacy endpoints"
}

deprecation_schedule {
    1.x: deprecated @ 3.0.0, removed @ 4.0.0
    2.0: deprecated @ 3.5.0, removed @ 5.0.0
}
```

## Schema Registry Pattern

For larger systems, track all evolutions:

```dol
mod schema.registry @ 0.8.0

schema_registry {
    User: [UserV1, UserV1_1, UserV2, UserV3]
    Product: [ProductV1, ProductV2, ProductV3]
    Order: [OrderV1, OrderV2]

    current {
        User: UserV3
        Product: ProductV3
        Order: OrderV2
    }

    migrations {
        User: [
            UserV1 > UserV1_1 @ 1.1.0,
            UserV1_1 > UserV2 @ 2.0.0,
            UserV2 > UserV3 @ 3.0.0
        ]
    }
}
```

## Practice Exercise

Define evolution for an `Article` type:
1. V1: id, title, content, author_id
2. V2: Add published_at (optional), tags (empty list), and slug (derived from title)
3. V3: Add category (required with default), remove deprecated author_id, add author (full object)

<Collapsible title="Solution">
```dol
mod blog.articles @ 0.8.0

gen ArticleV1 {
    has id: u64
    has title: string
    has content: string
    has author_id: u64
}

gen ArticleV2 {
    has id: u64
    has title: string
    has content: string
    has author_id: u64
    has published_at: Option<Timestamp>
    has tags: Vec<string>
    has slug: string
}

evo ArticleV1 > ArticleV2 @ 1.1.0 {
    + published_at: Option<Timestamp> = None
    + tags: Vec<string> = []
    => title to (title, slug) {
        (title, slugify(title))
    }
}

gen ArticleV3 {
    has id: u64
    has title: string
    has content: string
    has published_at: Option<Timestamp>
    has tags: Vec<string>
    has slug: string
    has category: Category
    has author: Author
}

gen Author {
    has id: u64
    has name: string
    has email: string
    has avatar_url: Option<string>
}

gen Category {
    kind: enum {
        Uncategorized,
        Technology,
        Science,
        Business,
        Lifestyle,
        Opinion
    }
}

evo ArticleV2 > ArticleV3 @ 2.0.0 {
    + category: Category = Category.Uncategorized
    - author_id: u64
    + author: Author = lookup_author(author_id)
}
```
