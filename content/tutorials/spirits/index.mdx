# Spirit Development Track

Build secure, composable programs that run in the VUDO runtime. Spirits are WebAssembly modules with controlled access to system resources through a capability-based security model.

<Prerequisites items={[
  { text: "DOL Fundamentals track", link: "/tutorials/dol" },
  { text: "Basic Rust knowledge", link: "https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/" },
  { text: "VUDO CLI installed", link: "/dol/install" }
]} />

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this track, you'll be able to:

- Understand the Spirit architecture and security model
- Create, build, and run Spirits using VUDO CLI
- Use host functions for time, logging, and random numbers
- Implement persistent storage for Spirit state
- Make network requests from Spirits
- Manage credits and economic incentives
- Test Spirits with mocked host functions
- Package and publish Spirits to the Imaginarium

## The Spirit Model

Spirits represent a new paradigm for composable, secure software:

|  |  time::now()  storage::read()  network::request() |            |
|  +---------------------------------------------------+            |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Key Principles

1. **Sandboxed Execution**: Spirits run in isolated WebAssembly environments with no direct system access
2. **Capability-Based Security**: Spirits must declare required capabilities in their manifest
3. **Controlled Resources**: All system interactions go through auditable host functions
4. **Economic Incentives**: Credit system encourages efficient resource usage
5. **Composability**: Spirits can invoke other Spirits through controlled interfaces

## Prerequisites Check

Before starting this track, verify your environment:

```bash
# Check VUDO installation
vudo --version

# Verify Rust toolchain
rustup show

# Ensure wasm32 target is installed
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Check cargo-component (for Spirit builds)
cargo component --version
```

If any commands fail, visit the [installation guide](/dol/install) to set up your environment.
