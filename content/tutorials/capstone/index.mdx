# Lion & Swan Capstone Project

Build a complete AI-powered mythological content creator that generates images and narratives from the Lion & Swan mythology. This capstone project brings together everything you have learned: DOL specifications, Spirit development, and VUDO CLI tooling.

<Callout type="info" title="The Capstone Challenge">
This is the final project of the Univrs learning tracks. You will create a production-ready Spirit that demonstrates mastery of specification-driven development, capability-based security, and mycelial economics.

## The Lion & Swan Mythology

The Lion & Swan mythology serves as a **self-correcting narrative system** for the Univrs.io ecosystem. It embodies the philosophical tensions at the heart of decentralized systems.

### The Black Lion

The Black Lion represents the **Keepers of Light** - guardians of harmony achieved through mycelial economics. Like obsidian, the Lion absorbs chaos and reflects order. The Keepers maintain balance not through force, but through the invisible networks of mutual benefit.

### The White Swan

The White Swan represents **transformation** - the promise and danger of change. Like pearl formed through irritation, the Swan emerges from conflict. It can lead to liberation or destructive revivalism, depending on how transformation is channeled.

### The Self-Correcting Narrative

Each generation must ask: *Are we Lions protecting harmony, or have we become oppressors?* The mythology provides a framework for questioning power structures while maintaining system stability.

## What You Will Build

The **Lion & Swan Creator** Spirit generates:

1. **Mythic Images**: AI-generated artwork depicting Lion and Swan archetypes
2. **Narrative Content**: Story fragments, prophecies, and meditations
3. **Combined Artifacts**: Image-text pairs for use in the Univrs ecosystem

### Features

- Complete DOL specification for the mythology
- AI image generation using network capabilities
- Narrative text generation with templating
- Credit-based economic model
- Full test coverage
- Published to the Imaginarium

## The Journey Ahead

This capstone synthesizes everything you have learned:

| Track | Skills Applied |
|-------|---------------|
| **DOL Fundamentals** | Type definitions, traits, constraints, exegesis |
| **Spirit Development** | Host functions, storage, networking, credits |
| **CLI Mastery** | Templates, REPL, quality tools, registry |

By the end, you will have:

- A complete, working Spirit
- Published to the Imaginarium
- Generating real mythological content
- Earning credits through the mycelial economy

## Prerequisites Check

Verify your environment before starting:

```bash
# Check VUDO CLI version (need 0.3+)
vudo --version

# Verify Rust toolchain
rustup show

# Ensure wasm32 target
rustup target list --installed | grep wasm32

# Check available templates
vudo template list
```

## Recommended Approach

1. **Follow in order**: Each step builds on the previous
2. **Type the code**: Do not just copy-paste; understand each line
3. **Run tests frequently**: Catch issues early
4. **Read the exegesis**: The mythology has meaning; let it inform your implementation
5. **Take breaks**: This is a substantial project

<Callout type="warning" title="Estimated Time">
Plan for 6-8 hours to complete this capstone. You may want to spread it across multiple sessions.
