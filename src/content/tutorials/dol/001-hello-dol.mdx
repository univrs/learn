# Hello DOL

Welcome to your first DOL lesson! DOL (Design Ontology Language) is a **specification language** for building self-aware systems. Unlike traditional programming languages that focus on *how* to do things, DOL focuses on *what* things are and how they relate to each other.

## What Makes DOL Different?

DOL is not a general-purpose programming language. Instead, it is a language for describing **ontologies** - formal specifications of what exists in your system, what properties things have, and what rules they must follow.

Think of DOL as a way to write a "contract" that describes your system's structure and rules.

## Your First Gene

The fundamental building block in DOL is the **gene**. A gen declares an entity and its properties.

Here is the simplest possible DOL specification:

```dol
gen hello.world {
  message has content
  message has sender
  message has timestamp
}

docs {
  The hello.world gen is the simplest possible DOL example. It defines
  a message entity with three essential properties: content (what the
  message says), sender (who sent it), and timestamp (when it was sent).

  This demonstrates the basic pattern:
  - gen <domain>.<name> declares a new gene
  - <entity> has <property> declares properties
  - exegesis explains the intent and usage
}
```

Let's break down what we just wrote.

## Understanding the Structure

### The Gene Declaration

```dol
gen hello.world {
  ...
}
```

- `gene` is the keyword that starts a gen declaration
- `hello.world` is a **qualified identifier** - names in DOL use dot notation to create namespaces
- The curly braces `{ }` contain the gene's body

### The `has` Predicate

```dol
message has content
message has sender
message has timestamp
```

The `has` predicate declares that an entity possesses a property:
- `message` is the entity we are describing
- `has` is the predicate keyword
- `content`, `sender`, `timestamp` are properties

This says: "A message has content, a message has sender, a message has timestamp."

### The Exegesis

```dol
docs {
  Description of the gen goes here...
}
```

**Exegesis is mandatory** in DOL. Every declaration must include an `docs` block that explains:
- What the declaration represents
- Why it exists
- How it should be used

Exegesis is not just documentation - it's a first-class part of the specification that can be parsed and analyzed.

## Another Example: Containers

Here's a more complete example from the DOL codebase:

```dol
gen container.exists {
  container has identity
  container has status
  container has boundaries
  container has resources
  container has image
}

docs {
  The container gen defines the essential properties of a container in
  the Univrs platform. A container is an isolated execution environment
  that encapsulates a workload.

  Identity: Every container has a unique cryptographic identity derived
  from an Ed25519 keypair. This identity is immutable for the container's
  lifetime and serves as the basis for all authentication.

  State: Containers exist in discrete states (created, running, paused,
  stopped, archived). State transitions are atomic and authenticated.

  Boundaries: Resource isolation is enforced through Linux namespaces and
  cgroups. A container cannot escape its boundaries.

  Resources: CPU, memory, network, and storage allocations are declared
  and enforced. Resource limits are constraints, not suggestions.

  Image: The container's filesystem derives from an OCI-compliant image.
  The image is immutable; runtime changes use copy-on-write layers.
}
```

Notice how the exegesis provides rich context about what each property means and why it matters.

## Comments in DOL

DOL supports two styles of comments:

```dol
// Single-line comment

/* Multi-line
   comment */

/// Documentation comment (for inline docs)
```

Comments are for code authors. Exegesis is for specification consumers.

## Running DOL

To work with DOL files, you can use the DOL compiler:

```bash
# Install DOL
cargo install dol --features cli

# Parse a DOL file
dol-parse example.dol

# Check a DOL file for errors
dol-check example.dol
```

## The `is` Predicate

Besides `has`, DOL uses the `is` predicate to declare states or traits:

```dol
gen identity.cryptographic {
  identity has keypair
  identity has algorithm

  identity is immutable
  identity is verifiable
}

docs {
  A cryptographic identity is an entity that cannot change (immutable)
  and can be verified through cryptographic proofs (verifiable).
}
```

The `is` predicate says something **about the nature** of an entity, while `has` says what properties it possesses.

## Key Takeaways

- DOL is a **specification language**, not a general-purpose programming language
- **Genes** are the fundamental building blocks that declare entities and properties
- Use **qualified identifiers** with dot notation: `domain.name`
- The `has` predicate declares properties: `entity has property`
- The `is` predicate declares states or traits: `entity is state`
- **Exegesis is mandatory** - every declaration must be explained

## Practice Exercise

Try writing a gen that describes a "user account" with these properties:
- A user has username
- A user has email
- A user has created_at
- A user is authenticated

Remember to include an exegesis block explaining what a user account represents!

```dol
gen account.user {
  // Your declarations here...
}

docs {
  // Your explanation here...
}
```

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, we'll explore DOL's type system and learn how to add type annotations to our properties.
