# Hello DOL

Welcome to your first DOL lesson! In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the DOL REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) and write your first program.

## What is DOL?

DOL (Design Ontology Language) is a specification language for building self-aware systems. Unlike traditional programming languages that focus on *how* to do things, DOL focuses on *what* things are and how they relate to each other.

But before we dive into ontologies and specifications, let us start with the basics.

## The DOL REPL

The REPL is an interactive environment where you can type DOL code and see results immediately. It is perfect for learning and experimenting.

To start the REPL on your machine, run:

```bash
dol repl
```

You will see a prompt like this:

```
DOL v0.2.3 REPL
Type :help for commands, :quit to exit

dol>
```

## Your First Program

The traditional first program in any language is "Hello, World!" In DOL, we use the `log()` function to output text.

Try running this code:

<DOLRepl
  code={`// Your first DOL program
log("Hello, DOL!")`}
  title="hello.dol"
  output="Hello, DOL!"
/>

Congratulations! You have written your first DOL program.

## Understanding the Code

Let us break down what happened:

### Comments

The line starting with `//` is a **comment**. Comments are ignored by DOL and are used to explain your code to humans (including your future self).

```dol
// This is a single-line comment

/* This is a
   multi-line comment */
```

### The log() Function

`log()` is a built-in function that outputs values to the console. It can print strings, numbers, and any other DOL value.

<DOLRepl
  code={`// log() can output different types
log("A string")
log(42)
log(3.14)
log(true)`}
  title="log-examples.dol"
  output={`A string
42
3.14
true`}
/>

### Strings

Text in DOL is represented as **strings**. Strings are enclosed in double quotes (`""`):

```dol
"Hello, DOL!"
"This is a string"
"Strings can contain numbers: 123"
```

## Multiple Statements

You can write multiple statements in a DOL program. Each statement is executed in order:

<DOLRepl
  code={`// Multiple log statements
log("First line")
log("Second line")
log("Third line")`}
  title="multiple.dol"
  output={`First line
Second line
Third line`}
/>

## String Concatenation

You can combine strings using the `+` operator:

<DOLRepl
  code={`// Combining strings
let greeting = "Hello"
let name = "World"
log(greeting + ", " + name + "!")`}
  title="concat.dol"
  output="Hello, World!"
/>

We will learn more about `let` bindings in the next lesson, but this gives you a preview of how DOL handles variables.

## REPL Commands

The DOL REPL has special commands that start with `:`. Here are the most useful ones:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `:help` | Show available commands |
| `:quit` or `:q` | Exit the REPL |
| `:clear` | Clear the screen |
| `:type <expr>` | Show the type of an expression |
| `:load <file>` | Load and run a DOL file |

Try typing `:type "hello"` in the REPL to see the type of a string.

## Expressions vs Statements

In DOL, almost everything is an **expression** that produces a value. This is different from many languages where statements do not return values.

<DOLRepl
  code={`// The last expression's value is returned
let x = 5
let y = 10
x + y`}
  title="expressions.dol"
  output="15"
/>

When you type an expression in the REPL without using `log()`, the REPL automatically shows its value.

## Key Takeaways

- The DOL REPL lets you interactively run code
- Use `log()` to output values
- Comments start with `//` for single-line or `/* */` for multi-line
- Strings are enclosed in double quotes
- Almost everything in DOL is an expression

## Challenge

Now it is your turn! Modify the code below to:

1. Print your name
2. Print today's date
3. Add a comment explaining what the program does

<DOLRepl
  code={`// Challenge: Personalize this program
log("Hello, DOL!")
log("Today is a great day to learn!")`}
  title="challenge.dol"
  output={`Hello, DOL!
Today is a great day to learn!`}
/>

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, we will explore DOL's type system and learn about all the different values you can work with.
