# DOL Fundamentals

Welcome to the DOL Fundamentals track! This series of 8 tutorials will take you from your first DOL specification to building complete, self-documenting ontologies with genes, traits, constraints, and modular architecture.

## What You Will Learn

By the end of this track, you will be able to:

- Write DOL specifications using genes, traits, and constraints
- Work with all primitive types and collections
- Define functions and methods on genes
- Control program flow with expressions and pattern matching
- Create traits for behavior and constraints for invariants
- Handle errors gracefully with Result and Option types
- Organize specifications into reusable modules

## Track Overview

| # | Lesson | Duration | Concepts |
|---|--------|----------|----------|
| 1 | [Hello DOL](/dol/tutorials/001-hello-dol) | 15 min | genes, exegesis, has/is predicates |
| 2 | [Values and Types](/dol/tutorials/002-values-types) | 15 min | primitives, typed genes, enums |
| 3 | [Functions](/dol/tutorials/003-functions) | 20 min | fun keyword, methods, closures |
| 4 | [Control Flow](/dol/tutorials/004-control-flow) | 20 min | if/else, match, pattern matching |
| 5 | [Collections](/dol/tutorials/005-collections) | 20 min | List, Map, Option, functional methods |
| 6 | [Traits and Constraints](/dol/tutorials/006-traits-constraints) | 25 min | trait, constraint, uses, invariants |
| 7 | [Error Handling](/dol/tutorials/007-error-handling) | 15 min | Result, Option, `?` operator |
| 8 | [Modules and Imports](/dol/tutorials/008-modules-imports) | 15 min | module, use, requires, systems |

## Prerequisites

No prior DOL experience is required! However, familiarity with any programming language will help you progress faster.

You should have:
- DOL installed on your system ([Installation Guide](/dol/reference/installation))
- A code editor with DOL syntax highlighting (optional but recommended)
- Basic understanding of programming concepts (types, functions, etc.)

## How to Use These Tutorials

Each lesson includes:

1. **Introduction** - Context and learning objectives
2. **Code Examples** - DOL specifications you can study and modify
3. **Explanations** - Step-by-step breakdown of concepts
4. **Practice Exercise** - A hands-on exercise to reinforce learning

We recommend completing the lessons in order, as each builds on concepts from previous tutorials.
