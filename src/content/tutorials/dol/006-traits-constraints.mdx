# Traits and Constraints

DOL's ontology system goes beyond genes. **Traits** define behaviors and state machines, while **constraints** enforce invariants. Together, they create robust, self-documenting specifications.

## Traits

A **trait** defines behaviors, states, and transitions that entities can exhibit:

```dol
trait container.lifecycle {
  uses container.exists

  container is created
  container is starting
  container is running
  container is stopping
  container is stopped
  container is removing
  container is removed

  forall transition emits event
}

exegesis {
  The container lifecycle defines the state machine that governs
  container execution. Transitions between states are atomic and
  emit events for observability. The lifecycle ensures predictable
  behavior from creation through removal.
}
```

### Trait Syntax

A trait declaration includes:
- `trait domain.name { }` - declares the trait
- `uses gene.name` - depends on another gene
- `entity is state` - declares possible states
- `exegesis { }` - explains the trait's purpose

### State Declarations

The `is` predicate declares states an entity can be in:

```dol
trait message.delivery {
  uses hello.world

  message is pending
  message is delivered
  message is failed
  message is retrying

  delivery has attempts
  delivery has last_error
}

exegesis {
  Message delivery tracks the state of message transmission.
  Messages start pending, transition to delivered on success,
  or to failed/retrying on error. The delivery state machine
  ensures reliable message handling.
}
```

### Composing Traits

Traits can build on other traits using `uses`:

```dol
trait container.observable {
  uses container.lifecycle

  container emits metrics
  container emits logs
  container emits traces
}

exegesis {
  Observable containers emit telemetry data. This trait
  extends lifecycle to add observability requirements.
  All state transitions produce structured events.
}
```

## Constraints

**Constraints** enforce rules that must always be true:

```dol
constraint container.integrity {
  state == declared
  identity not changes
  boundaries not expand
  resources not exceeds
}

exegesis {
  Container integrity constraints ensure that runtime behavior exactly matches
  the ontological declarations made at creation time. This prevents the common
  failure mode where containers drift from their intended specifications through
  mutation, resource creep, or boundary violations. By requiring state to match
  declared properties, we guarantee that what the system believes about a
  container remains true throughout its lifecycle. The immutability of identity
  ensures containers cannot masquerade as other entities, while fixed boundaries
  prevent unauthorized expansion that could compromise isolation. Resource limits
  protect the system from container overreach that could destabilize other
  components. Together, these constraints form an invariant bridge between
  ontology and runtime, making the abstract concrete and the declared enforceable.
}
```

### Constraint Keywords

DOL constraints use specific keywords:

| Keyword | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `==` | Value must equal declared specification |
| `not` | Action is prohibited |
| `always` | Condition must hold at all times |
| `requires` | Prerequisite condition |

### Property Constraints

Ensure properties maintain specific relationships:

```dol
constraint resource.allocation {
  used not exceeds allocated
  allocated not exceeds maximum
  minimum not exceeds allocated
}

exegesis {
  Resource allocation constraints ensure resources stay within
  defined bounds. Used resources cannot exceed allocation, and
  allocation must stay between minimum and maximum limits.
}
```

### Identity Constraints

Protect immutable aspects of entities:

```dol
constraint identity.cryptographic {
  keypair not changes
  public_key extends keypair
  signature is verifiable
}

exegesis {
  Cryptographic identity constraints ensure that identity remains
  stable and verifiable throughout an entity's lifetime. The keypair
  is generated once and not modified.
}
```

## Typed Traits

Traits can include typed declarations:

```dol
pub trait Hashable {
  fun hash() -> UInt64

  exegesis {
    Hashable types can produce a deterministic hash value.
  }
}

pub trait Comparable {
  fun compare(other: Self) -> Ordering

  exegesis {
    Comparable types can be ordered relative to each other.
  }
}

pub gene Ordering {
  type: enum {
    Less,
    Equal,
    Greater
  }
}
```

### Implementing Traits

Genes can declare that they implement traits:

```dol
pub gene MyceliumNode {
  has id: UInt64
  has position: Vec3
  has connections: List<UInt64>

  implements Hashable {
    fun hash() -> UInt64 {
      return this.id
    }
  }

  exegesis {
    A node in the mycelium network. Uses its unique ID
    as its hash value.
  }
}
```

## Combining Traits and Constraints

A complete specification often uses both:

```dol
gene container.exists {
  container has identity
  container has status
  container has boundaries
  container has resources
  container has image
}

exegesis {
  The container gene defines essential container properties.
}

trait container.lifecycle {
  uses container.exists

  container is created
  container is starting
  container is running
  container is stopping
  container is stopped
  container is removing
  container is removed

  forall transition emits event
}

exegesis {
  Container lifecycle manages state transitions.
}

constraint container.integrity {
  state == declared
  identity not changes
  boundaries not expand
  resources not exceeds
}

exegesis {
  Container integrity ensures runtime matches specification.
}
```

## Trait Bounds

Use traits as type constraints:

```dol
pub fun sort<T: Comparable>(items: List<T>) -> List<T> {
  // T must implement Comparable
  // implementation can use compare() method
}

pub fun store<T: Hashable + Comparable>(item: T) -> UInt64 {
  // T must implement both Hashable and Comparable
  return item.hash()
}
```

## System Constraints

Systems can have their own constraints:

```dol
system mycelium.network @0.1.0 {
  requires transport.protocol >= 0.0.1
  uses MyceliumNode

  state nodes: Map<UInt64, MyceliumNode>
  state edges: List<HyphalSegment>

  constraint {
    nodes.len() <= 10000
    edges.len() <= nodes.len() * 10
  }
}

exegesis {
  Mycelium network system with size constraints.
  Limits prevent unbounded growth.
}
```

## Key Takeaways

- **Traits** define behaviors and state machines with `trait name { }`
- Use `is` to declare states: `entity is state`
- Use `uses` to compose traits: `uses other.trait`
- **Constraints** enforce invariants with `constraint name { }`
- Use `==` for equality: `value == declared`
- Use `not` for prohibitions: `property not changes`
- Use `forall` for quantified predicates: `forall x in items`
- Traits can include method signatures for implementation
- Combine traits and constraints for complete specifications

## Practice Exercise

Create a trait and constraint for a user authentication system:

```dol
gene user.account {
  user has username
  user has email
  user has password_hash
  user has created_at
  user has last_login
}

exegesis {
  User account with authentication credentials.
}

trait user.authentication {
  uses user.account

  // Add states for:
  // - user is active
  // - user is suspended
  // - user is locked
  // - session states
}

exegesis {
  // Your explanation here
}

constraint user.security {
  // Add constraints for:
  // - password_hash not exposed
  // - email == pattern
  // - username not changes
}

exegesis {
  // Your explanation here
}
```
